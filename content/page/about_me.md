I'm a life-long developer who has worked on countless projects with countless languages. My current role began in 2009 when I co-founded [Core-apps](http://www.core-apps.com/) and wrote apps for Android, iOS, and mobile web. Over the past years, I went from being the sole developer to managing and mentoring a full development team.

My past development life has given me opportunities to work on a wide variety of projects in many different markets. I've done low-level work on multiple compilers and written serial communications for [laser capture microdissection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_capture_microdissection), but I also pride myself in having a keen eye for thoughtful user experience.

My passions are currently being fulfilled with the startup that I co-founded and as such I am not currently looking for other opportunities.
